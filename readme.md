# Pocket Export Experiment

You need to download your Pocket history at <https://getpocket.com/export> and put it at the root of the projet.  
Then just launch the nodeJS script :

```
node index.js >> pocket_export.csv
```

let it loop over all your links and wait for the results.
You can stop and resume later if you need.
